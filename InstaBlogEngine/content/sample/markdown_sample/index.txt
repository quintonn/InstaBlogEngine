# Example Heading

This post was made using markdown instead of html

## Smaller Heading

This is another paragraph but with a smaller heading

It is a bit easier to format  
content over multiple lines

# Sample Code

It is also a bit easier to add sample code

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

# Another section

![test 1](random.jpg "Test 2")
